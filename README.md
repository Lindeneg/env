My environment on Windows 10.
Effectively a Bash facade on top of a pure NT environment.

This is mostly just for myself, so I can easily retrieve my configurations.

Essential tools:

Default Terminal. It's actually decent.
[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

Default shell. Git-Bash can run inside Windows Terminal.
[Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Default editor. nvim has blown me away, it is great!
[neovim](https://neovim.io/)

gcc,g++,gdb,make etc.. what's not to like?
[MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases)

I also quite like LLVM toolchain, especially clang format/tidy.

Hands down, RemedyBG is amazing.

I love tmux (tmux is why *almost* everything is unbound in windows terminal)
