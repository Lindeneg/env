My environment on Windows 10.
Effectively a Bash facade on top of a pure NT environment. 

I tried WSL for a while but did not like it. I liked WSL2 more but since settling on the below setup, I hardly use WSL anyways.

This is mostly just for myself, so I can easily retrieve my configurations.

Essential tools:

----

Default Terminal. It's actually decent.

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

----

Default shell. Git-Bash can run inside Windows Terminal.

[Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

----

Default editor. nvim has blown me away, it is great!

[neovim](https://neovim.io/)

----

gcc,g++,gdb,make etc.. what's not to like?

[MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases)

----

I also quite like LLVM toolchain, especially clang format/tidy.

----

Hands down, RemedyBG is amazing.

lazygit is.. pretty neat.

I love tmux (tmux is why *almost* everything is unbound in windows terminal)
